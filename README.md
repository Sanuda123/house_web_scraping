# House Web Scraping Application

## What will the application do?
This web application is designed to run web scraping scripts on various property rental websites. The user will specify a city in Canada where they are looking for a property, and the script will gather information accordingly. The gathered information will then be processed and stored in a database. Once the scripts have run, the user will be able to query the data through the frontend, and will be sent a list of properties that meet their requirements. If a certain property seems appealing, a link is provided back to the source website, where the user can purchase the property.
